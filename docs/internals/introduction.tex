\section{Purpose of this document}

This document aims to provide a detailed description of the internals of the zerOS operating system. It is intended for developers who want to contribute to the project, or simply understand how it works.

It also serves as a reference, a way to keep track of the design decisions and the implementation details.

\section{What is zerOS?}

zerOS aims to be a multi-platform\footnote{Only amd64 support is worked on, for now.} operating system, built from scratch. It is mainly written in Rust, with some parts in C and assembly. It started as a personal learning project, to understand how operating systems work.
